# John Arby Arceo Test - Setup Guide

This guide provides instructions to set up and run the Laravel 11 application using Docker on Windows, Linux, and Mac.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
-   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Create the Environment File

Copy the example environment file:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Modify the `.env` file as needed, ensuring database credentials match the Docker setup (ensure the DB_HOST is mysql to connect to docker mysql):

```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=mysql
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_database
DB_USERNAME=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### 2. Build and Start the Containers

Run the following command to build and start the Docker containers:

```sh
docker-compose up -d --build
```

This will start the following services:

-   **app** (Laravel application running PHP-FPM)
-   **nginx** (Web server for Laravel, accessible via `http://viptutorstest.local`)
-   **mysql** (Database service)

### 3. Install Laravel Dependencies

Run the following command inside the `app` container:

```sh
docker exec -it laravel-app bash -c "composer install && php artisan key:generate"
```

### 4. Run Database Migrations

For Database Migration please wait for 2-5 mins as it may take a while to initialize inside the docker container

```sh
docker exec -it laravel-app bash -c "php artisan migrate"
```

### 5. Update Hosts File (Windows Only)

If you are on Windows, you need to manually update your hosts file (Run Notepad as Administrator):

```sh
notepad C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
```

Add the following line at the bottom:

```
127.0.0.1  viptutorstest.local
```

For Linux/Mac users, modify `/etc/hosts` using:

```sh
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

And add:

```
127.0.0.1  viptutorstest.local
```

Save the file and exit.

### 6. Running Vite for Frontend Assets

To run Vite and avoid CORS issues, execute:

```sh
docker exec -it laravel-app bash -c "npm run build"
```

### 7. Access the Application

Once the setup is complete, visit:

```
http://viptutorstest.local
```

## Managing Containers

### Stopping the Containers

```sh
docker-compose down
```

### Restarting the Containers

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

### Viewing Logs

```sh
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Accessing the Laravel Container

```sh
docker exec -it laravel-app bash
```

## Troubleshooting

### MySQL Connection Error

If you see `SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] Connection refused`, restart the MySQL container:

```sh
docker-compose restart mysql
```

### 504 Gateway Timeout

If you encounter a **504 Gateway Timeout**, try increasing `fastcgi_read_timeout` in `nginx.conf` and restarting Nginx:

```sh
docker-compose restart nginx
```

### Permission Issues

If you encounter file permission issues, run:

```sh
docker exec -it laravel-app bash -c "chmod -R 777 storage bootstrap/cache"
```

## Additional Notes

-   Ensure Docker is running before executing commands.
-   Restart the containers if you modify `.env`.

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
